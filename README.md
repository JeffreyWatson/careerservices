Hello, My name is Jeffrey Watson, 27 years old, and new to the world of developing. 
I was recently introduced to the idea of developing and ever since I dipped my toes in the water I have been extremely intrigued in learning more and becoming more knowledgeable in the creation of web applications. My interests of Video Games, and CryptoCurrency have also lead me to become more motivated in learing how all of this works behind the scenes. Ive always been a consumer/user and I now know that I want that to change and transition into a position of creator and/or developer of these above interests. 
Im currently enrolled at Boise CodeWorks Academy. Currently in week 5 of the bootcamp and I am learning more than I ever expected I was capable of learning. I firmly believe that with this bootcamp I can be fitted with several tools necessary to becoming a highly effecient software developer in the great Treasure Valley.
My interests in collaborating with projects is far and wide. To pin point a particular project at this point would not be reasonable. However, I am willing and open to about anything at this point in time and look forward to using my knowledge once this course is said and done.
